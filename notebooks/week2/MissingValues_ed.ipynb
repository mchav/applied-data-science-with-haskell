    "Missing values are pretty common in data cleaning activities. And, missing values can be there for any number of reasons. For instance, if you are running a survey and a respondant didn't answer a question the missing value is actually an omission.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of missing data is called **Missing at Random**. There's no physical or logic reason why the data is missing, in fact you could probably use other variables to predict it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no relationship to other variables, then we call this data **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just two examples of missing data, and there are many more. For instance, data might be missing because it wasn't collected, either by the process responsible for collecting that data, such as a researcher, or because it wouldn't make sense if it were collected. This last example is extremely common when you start joining DataFrames together from multiple sources, such as joining a list of people at a university with a list of offices in the university (students generally don't have offices).\n",
