# applied-data-science-with-haskell
A Haskell port of the exercises in the Applied Data Science With Python Coursera specialisation.

## How to run these notebooks
* **Clone this repository**: `git clone https://github.com/mchav/applied-data-science-with-haskell`
* **Navigate into the directory**: `cd applied-data-science-with-haskell`
* **Open visual studio code**: `code .`
* **Start the devcontainer**: There should be a popup on the bottom right that says `Folder contains a Dev Container configuration file. Reopen folder to develop in a container.` Click the button labelled Reopen in Container. Downloading the image should take a few minutes.
* **Start the Haskell kernel**: Go to any of the notebooks. At the top right there should be a tab that says `Select Kernel`. Click it and then select `Jupyter Kernel`. From the option of kernels that pops up select `Haskell`.
* **Run the notebooks**: Once done run the first cell in the notebook by pressing `Shift + Enter`. The first run should take a minute or so but subsequent run should be much faster.
